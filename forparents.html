       Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that 12.5 million children and young adults between 
       2 and 19 years of age have obesity, and another 10 percent are overweight.
   </p>
   <p>
       Children and teens with overweight or obesity can develop health issues, like diabetes, liver inflammation, high blood pressure, 
       breathing problems during sleep and many other medical problems. These conditions can affect how they learn, play, and interact 
       with their peers and grow into adulthood.
   </p>
   <p>
       Children and teens with overweight or obesity may have medical conditions like hypertension, depression, diabetes, and obstructive 
       sleep. They are twice as likely to die before age 55 compared to children without obesity. They may be socially isolated and also be 
       bullied.
   </p>
   <p>
       Obesity can be caused by a variety of factors such as : easy access to unhealthy food and drinks, too much sitting, poor sleeping 
       habits, stress, anxiety, genetics, and hormone conditions.
   </p>
   <p>
       If your child has obesity, first have him or her checked by their pediatrician. Weight improvement comes from reducing calories 
       eaten while increasing physical activity. Less food and drink and more physical activity means the body looks for energy where it 
       is stored in body fat, thus burning calories and losing fat.

        According to the past data, the rate at which female youth obesity increases about 0.45% each year and the male youth obesity rate 
        increases at 0.375% each year. With this data in mind, the obesity rate for female youths in 2025 would be at around 25% and the male 
        youths would be at 23%. This means about 1 in 4 youths in America are considered obese in the year 2025 if this trend continues.
